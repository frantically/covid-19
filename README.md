# covid19

## TODO
### Functionality
* First grid line color not working - easier to see in light mode
* Include +/- % in last week
* hospitalization - how to show cantons?
* tear drop?
* Compare to other countries?
* VALIDATE DATA AGAINST CORONA-DATA.CH THIS IS LOWER
* Canton selector?

### Missing Test Cases
* getMovingAverage
* maxDate
* lastWeek and priorWeek - will need longer data or configurable days
