# covid19

## TODO
### Functionality
* STRIP OUT THE EARLY DAYS WITH LITTLE DATA?
* Include +/- % in last week
* Canton selector?
* hospitalization - how to show cantons?
* tear drop?
* Compare to other countries?
* Make it clear that the last complete day is used in the last week calc
* VALIDATE DATA AGAINST CORONA-DATA.CH THIS IS LOWER

### Missing Test Cases
* getMovingAverage
* maxDate
* lastWeek and priorWeek - will need longer data or configurable days
